## Purpose

My portfolio was made to showcase my skills and abilities to future employers. It is also there to show others the languages I have learnt and what reasons based on my personality they should hire me.

## Functionality  / Features

#### Minimalistic design

My website was designed from the bottom to have a very simple minimalist design to not clutter the users viewport and allow them to focus on what is most important. My choice of 3 colors was there to make it easier on the minimal design.

#### Scroll Snap

The portfolio takes advantage of the `scroll-snap-type` features given to css. I used this to make the browsing experience clean and focused. Through viewing this on mobile, tablet or in your browser the experience will be the same smooth locking experience.

#### Hamburger Menu

Only viewable on mobile and tablet the hamburger menu will appear and make the navigation experience smooth and tight. 

#### Contact

The contact page utilizes a `form` with an action of `mailto:`. This allows people to easily  reach out to me for whatever opportunities they would like to present. The form uses some animations to make it very clear which category is currently selected or needs to be filled out.

#### Blog

The blog page allows for me to keep my users updated on if I find anything interesting or important for the industry. I will later change this to update with my medium  articles or medium articles I find interesting.

#### Links to my Social Pages

On my home page I have included a list of links to my main media pages, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub and an `a` tag with the `href` set to `mailto` for users to quickly mail me without browsing too far.
